# Key-logger.exe

What is a KeyLogger?

A software program or hardware device that records or transmits a user's keystrokes, and in some cases periodic screen shots, and is usually installed without the user's knowledge.


How to use it?

Go to dist directory, find keylog.exe, run it and it will start the keylogger as a background process which will create a 
logfile.txt at the dist directory and there the output will be stored.
