# Key-logger.exe

What is a KeyLogger?

A software program or hardware device that records or transmits a user's keystrokes, and in some cases periodic screen shots, and is usually installed without the user's knowledge.

Go to dist directory, find keylog.exe, run it and it will start the keylogger as a background process which will create a 
logfile.txt at the dist directory and there the output will be stored.
